# HomeView2

A simple Angular app to overlay various information over an existing web page. For my particular use case, the existing web page is the BlueIris (https://blueirissoftware.com) UI3 interface for showing security camera feeds on a monitor hooked up to a Raspberry Pi, and the information is the instanteous output from my home solar panels, as well as current UV index for my location.
